# Stream System

## **Streaming System** 
The streaming system was created to send information with zero overhead in general, reducing resource consumption and maximizing flexibility for the client, offering "tags" to execute special events of the tag, as well as including a dynamic event system. These events can be created remotely from other clients on the network, including unique behaviors in such streaming.

**The system works on the client side**, generating a kind of local queues that collect and queue the packages that are sent to them to be picked up soon.
