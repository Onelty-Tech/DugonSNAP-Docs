# Stream System

## **Streaming System** 

The **streaming system is a fast and efficient way to send real-time data**, **minimizing resource consumption** and adding layers of abstraction to maximize automation and client flexibility. **It provides various tools for working with it**, such as tags to trigger special events and a dynamic event system. These events can be created remotely from other clients on the network, including unique behaviors in the stream. **The system works on the client side**, generating a kind of local queues that collect and queue the packets sent to them for immediate collection.
