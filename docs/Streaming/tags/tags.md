# Tags

Tags unlock unique streaming capabilities, dividing streams by functionality and goals on the SNAP network.


## Purpose

Tags were initially created to divide the workflow between streams. This system unlocks different features and systems within streams, allowing for the separation of responsibilities and providing a layer of abstraction for users.



## Immutability

Tags in a stream cannot be changed or modified; they are immutable by nature, as they were designed to separate workflows and avoid causing confusion for other clients on the network.
