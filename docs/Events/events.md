# Events


In DugonSNAP, events are behaviors that go inside containers.

**The events system are specific to the client side**, such events cannot be executed by the server.


## Purpose

The event system was created to automate everyday use on the SNAP network. With these events, you have an abstraction layer that will help you communicate efficiently with the different devices on the network.
