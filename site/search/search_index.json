These events can be created remotely from other clients on the network, including unique behaviors in such streaming.</p> <ul> <li>Binary Packages: Binary packets carry a set of bytes, with no special predefined format, just pure bytes, such packets are queued in the client streamings.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/#binary-header","title":"Binary Header","text":"<p>The binary header is present in any packet on the network, whether it is a Container or a Binary Packet, the job of this binary header is to route and parse the packet.</p> <p>The binary header works with pure bytes, using its own format.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#origin-of-the-name","title":"Origin of the name","text":"<p>\"Dugon\" takes its name from the marine mammal \"Dugong\", chosen to represent the balance between strength, stability and intelligent system design.</p>"}]}
